# Windows Support

Intendant builds and runs on Windows. This page covers the supported target,
how to set up a development machine, the per-OS backend architecture, and the
known limitations of the Windows port.

> **Maturity.** The Windows backends compile and link cleanly for
> `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` and mirror the structure of the X11/macOS backends.
> The display pipeline has been **live-validated** end-to-end on a real Windows
> host: GDI `BitBlt` capture, Media Foundation H.264 encode, `SendInput`
> keyboard/mouse injection, and the encrypted WebRTC transport all work with
> real remote clients (display and input, over WebRTC). The voice **audio
> bridge** (VB-CABLE / WASAPI) is the one runtime path still pending end-to-end
> validation. Remaining gaps are called out under
> [Known Limitations](#known-limitations) — the port never panics or silently
> no-ops; unsupported paths return a clear error.

## Supported Target

| | |
|---|---|
| **Target triple** | `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` |
| **ABI** | MSVC (not the GNU ABI) |
| **Minimum OS** | Windows 10 / Windows 11 (client), Windows Server 2019+ |

The MSVC ABI is required: the Windows-only crates (`windows`, `windows-sys`,
`arboard`, `clipboard-win`) link against the Microsoft C runtime and the
Windows SDK import libraries. The `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` target is not
supported.

## Quickstart

The supported Windows path is still a source-build bootstrap. Run the setup
script from an elevated (Administrator) PowerShell in the repo root:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\setup-windows.ps1

# Read-only dependency check:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\setup-windows.ps1 -Check
```

By default, the script uses `-PackageManager Auto`: it uses an already-installed
`winget` first, then an already-installed Chocolatey. It does **not** install
Chocolatey by surprise. If you want the old one-command bootstrap behavior, make
that explicit:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\setup-windows.ps1 -PackageManager Chocolatey
```

Other useful modes:

```powershell
# Verify/install dependencies but skip the cargo build:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\setup-windows.ps1 -NoBuild

# Never install package-managed dependencies; report manual fixes instead:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\setup-windows.ps1 -PackageManager None

# Skip the runtime hello smoke check after build:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\setup-windows.ps1 -SkipSmoke
```

After a successful build, the script verifies that both release binaries exist
and runs a small `intendant-runtime` hello-command smoke check. It then prints a
status summary split into build, web/display, voice, and LAN readiness.

## Package Manager Policy

| Policy | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `Auto` | Use existing `winget`; else existing Chocolatey; else continue without package-managed installs and fail with manual instructions for missing deps. |
| `Winget` | Require `winget`; install packages through the Windows Package Manager. |
| `Chocolatey` | Install Chocolatey if missing, then install packages through Chocolatey. |
| `None` | Do not install package-managed dependencies; required build deps must already be present or the script reports manual fixes. |

`-Check` separates **required-to-build** dependencies from optional/runtime
ones and sets its **exit code accordingly**: it exits **nonzero** if any
required build dependency is missing or unusable, and **0** when they are all
present — so CI and automation can gate on it. A missing optional dependency
(`wasm-pack`, `ffmpeg`/`ffplay`, VB-CABLE) is reported but never fails the
check.

## What Gets Installed

**Required to build** (a missing/unusable one fails `-Check`):

- **rustup** with the default host set to `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
- **Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools** with the C++ workload
  (`Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools`; Chocolatey package
  `visualstudio2022-workload-vctools`) — provides `cl.exe`, `link.exe`, and the
  Windows SDK. Required even for `cargo check`.
- **NASM** — required to assemble the `ring` crypto crate on windows-msvc. The
  installer commonly places it in `C:\Program Files\NASM` and amends the
  *machine* `PATH`, which the current shell may not yet see; the script detects
  that case, adds the install directory to the current process `PATH`, and
  re-probes so `-Check` recognizes NASM even when it is not on the current
  `PATH`. Install mode also persists that PATH repair for future shells.
- **git**

**Optional / runtime / manual** (reported, but never fail `-Check`):

- **wasm-pack** (optional) — for rebuilding the presence-web WASM bundle.
- **ffmpeg** — the voice audio bridge shells out to `ffmpeg`/`ffplay`.
- **Media Foundation** — built into Windows client SKUs; on Windows Server the
  script enables the `Server-Media-Foundation` feature.
- **VB-CABLE** — manual, voice-only virtual audio cable setup. The script cannot
  install the vendor driver.

It then runs `cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, producing:

- `target\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\release\intendant.exe`
- `target\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\release\intendant-runtime.exe`

One step the script **cannot** automate is the **VB-CABLE** virtual audio cable
(the vendor ships a manual installer, not a package). The script prints
instructions and flags it in the final summary, but voice remains optional and
the Windows voice bridge is still pending end-to-end validation. See
[Audio](#audio-ffmpeg--vb-cable-wasapi-bridge) below.

Manual build, if you already have the toolchain:

```powershell
rustup set default-host x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

Provide an API key via a `.env` file or environment variables exactly as on the
other platforms (see [Getting Started](./getting-started.md)), then:

```powershell
.\target\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\release\intendant.exe "your task here"
.\target\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\release\intendant.exe --web
```

## Per-OS Backend Architecture

Intendant prefers platform-agnostic code; where the OS forces a difference, the
Windows implementation slots in behind the same trait or `cfg` gate the X11,
Wayland, and macOS backends use. The Windows-specific backends are:

### Capture — GDI `BitBlt` (default) + DXGI Desktop Duplication (opt-in)

`display/windows.rs` ships two capture paths behind the same `DisplayBackend`
seam, selected at runtime by the `INTENDANT_WINDOWS_CAPTURE` environment
variable (`gdi` | `dxgi`, case-insensitive; anything unset or unrecognized uses
the GDI default).

**GDI `BitBlt` — the default.** `BitBlt` from the screen device context reads
the **DWM-composed** desktop — the same pixels a user sees. Crucially it works
on *every* display adapter, including the virtual / indirect displays an
always-on host commonly runs on (RDP indirect display, cloud virtual display,
headless). The capture loop runs on a dedicated `std::thread` (GDI `HDC` /
`HBITMAP` handles are not `Send`) and `BitBlt`s the screen DC into a cached
top-down 32-bit DIB (`SRCCOPY | CAPTUREBLT`, so layered/overlay windows are
included). The DIB is BGRA8 top-down, so emitted rows are the identical
`DXGI_FORMAT_B8G8R8A8_UNORM` byte layout the DXGI path produces and feed the
existing `bgra_to_i420` / Media Foundation H.264 encoder unchanged.

**DXGI Desktop Duplication — opt-in fast path.** `IDXGIOutputDuplication` is the
GPU-accelerated path (zero-copy from the GPU into a CPU-readable staging
texture, lowest overhead on physical hardware). It is retained as an **opt-in**
fast path (`INTENDANT_WINDOWS_CAPTURE=dxgi`) for hosts with a real GPU/scanout.
It is **not** the default because it captures **all-black** frames on
virtual / RDP / cloud / headless adapters: those displays don't perform the
real frame presentation/scanout that Desktop Duplication requires, so it
"succeeds" yet duplicates black. Like the GDI path, the duplication interface,
the Direct3D 11 device, and the device context are single-threaded COM objects
that are not `Send` across `await`, so the loop runs on a dedicated
`std::thread` and feeds the tokio runtime over a bounded `mpsc` channel (the
same drop-on-full backpressure policy as the macOS and X11 backends).
`DXGI_ERROR_ACCESS_LOST` (resolution change, full-screen exclusive app,
secure-desktop/UAC transition, GPU mode switch) tears down and re-acquires the
duplication on the next iteration.

### Input — SendInput

Keyboard and mouse injection uses the Win32 **`SendInput`** API. Keyboard events
carry a Win32 virtual-key code (mapped in `display/windows_keymap.rs`) plus the
`KEYEVENTF_EXTENDEDKEY` flag for keys in the extended block. Mouse moves use
`MOUSEEVENTF_ABSOLUTE | MOUSEEVENTF_VIRTUALDESK`, scaling the browser's
normalized `0.0..1.0` coordinates into the `0..65535` absolute coordinate space
that spans the entire virtual desktop.

### Clipboard — arboard

Bidirectional clipboard sync uses the **`arboard`** crate (which wraps the Win32
clipboard API via `clipboard-win`), providing text and RGBA image get/set. This
is the one platform where the clipboard is handled in-process: the macOS and
Linux arms shell out to `pbcopy` / `wl-copy` / `xclip`.

### Encode — Media Foundation H264

Windows video encode targets **Media Foundation H264** (with NVENC as a hardware
path where available) rather than VP8/libvpx, and is live-validated over the
encrypted WebRTC transport with real clients. The libvpx-backed VP8 encoder is
gated **off** Windows in `Cargo.toml` (`cfg(not(target_os = "windows"))`), so the
MSVC build never tries to compile the `env-libvpx-sys` C-FFI crate (which needs a
C toolchain plus the vpx headers); the VP8 code paths are themselves `cfg`'d off
Windows. (The former OpenSSL C-FFI dependency is gone entirely — the LAN cert
subsystem is now pure-Rust via `rcgen` + `p12-keystore` — so nothing OpenSSL
needs gating on any platform.)

Because VP8 is unavailable, H.264 is also the **always-on baseline codec** in the
shared encoder pool on Windows (where macOS/Linux use VP8 simulcast as the
baseline) — a single full-resolution H.264 layer the Media Foundation encoder
serves, rather than a simulcast set. A baseline construction failure on Windows
degrades gracefully (the Video tab reports no stream; the rest of the dashboard
stays up) instead of panicking, because the pool is built eagerly at `--web`
startup. See [Display Pipeline](./display-pipeline.md#the-encoder-pool) for the
pool architecture.

### Audio — ffmpeg + VB-CABLE WASAPI bridge

There is no PulseAudio (Linux) or CoreAudio/BlackHole (macOS) on Windows. The
voice audio bridge instead routes through **VB-CABLE**, a virtual audio cable,
over WASAPI, shelling out to **`ffmpeg`/`ffplay`** to move audio in and out. VB-
CABLE is the Windows analogue of BlackHole on macOS / a PulseAudio null sink on
Linux: install it, then set **`CABLE Input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)`** as the
default playback device so the bridge can play synthesized speech into the cable
and capture microphone audio from it.

### Process and Network Introspection

`platform.rs` provides the Windows implementations of the cross-platform
process and network helpers:

- **Process liveness** — `OpenProcess` (query-only) + `GetExitCodeProcess`,
  since Windows has no `kill(pid, 0)` equivalent.
- **Process command line** — `NtQueryInformationProcess` with the
  `ProcessCommandLineInformation` class, falling back to
  `QueryFullProcessImageNameW` (executable path only) when the full command line
  is unavailable.
- **Routable local addresses** — the **`if-addrs`** crate (wrapping
  `GetAdaptersAddresses`) backs `lan::routable_local_addrs`, which feeds the
  web-gateway advertise URLs and WebRTC ICE host-candidate gathering. The Unix
  path keeps its direct `getifaddrs(3)` walk.

## Known Limitations

These are tracked deferrals, not bugs. Each degrades with a clear error rather
than a panic or silent no-op.

- **Interactive desktop session required.** Capture (`BitBlt` and DXGI),
  `SendInput`, and the WASAPI audio bridge all need an interactive desktop
  session. They do **not** work on the headless / service / disconnected-RDP
  "Session 0" desktop. Within an interactive session, frame delivery, H.264
  encode, input injection, and the encrypted WebRTC transport are
  live-validated; only the **voice audio bridge** is still pending end-to-end
  validation (see below).
- **Voice audio bridge pending validation.** The `ffmpeg` + VB-CABLE / WASAPI
  bridge is wired up but has not yet been validated end-to-end on a Windows
  host. It also requires the manual VB-CABLE install (see
  [Audio](#audio-ffmpeg--vb-cable-wasapi-bridge)).
- **`intendant lan` is gated off Windows.** The mTLS LAN-access *setup* command
  drives an nginx reverse proxy plus systemd/launchd service management and
  apt/brew package installs — none of which apply on Windows — so the Windows
  `LanBackend` returns `"intendant lan is not supported on Windows"`. (The
  certificate generation itself is now pure-Rust and cross-platform; only the
  proxy/service plumbing is Unix-specific.) To expose the dashboard to other
  devices from a Windows host, use native HTTPS/WSS via `--tls` (also pure-Rust
  and cross-platform), use the `scripts/setup-lan.bat` orchestrator (which drives
  `intendant lan` on a Linux guest over SSH/WSL), or front the dashboard with your
  own reverse proxy. See [Peer Federation](./peer-federation.md#lan-access-and-tls)
  for the full LAN/TLS and federation auth story.
- **No virtual-display equivalent.** There is no Windows analogue of Xvfb, so
  the lazily-launched virtual displays the Linux pipeline uses do not exist on
  Windows. Capture targets the real interactive desktop only.
- **Landlock sandboxing is Linux-only.** The `--sandbox` filesystem-restriction
  flag has no effect on Windows (it is a Linux LSM feature).
